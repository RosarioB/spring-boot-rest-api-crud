# spring-boot-rest-api-crud
Spring Boot Rest APIs with CRUD for MySQL. Each branch implements different features:

- **basic_crud**: contains the DAO interface EmployeeDAO and its implementation EmployeeDAOJpaImpl. The JPA methods for CRUD operations have been manually developed.
- **crud_spring_data_jpa**: makes use of Spring data JPA (EmployeeRepository) to implement the DAO. So the JPA methods for CRUD operations are auto generated by Spring Data JPA.
- **in_memory_spring_security**: in the class DemoSecurityConfig has been provided basic in memor authentication and authorization with Spring Security.
- **spring_security_jdbc_auth_default_tables**: provides Spring Security authentication via JDBC with default table (default Spring tbale names and columns-  cannot be changed) both with plaintext and bcrypt passwords (the code is the same the only thing that changes is the prefix {noop} or {bcrypt} before the passwords stored inside the database)
-  **spring_security_jdbc_auth_custom_tables** provides Spring Security authentication via JDBC with custom tables

In each branch the folder **sql-scripts** contains the SQL scripts to be run in MySQL.

NOTE: to make use of Spring dev tools on Intellij in Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment check Build Project Automatically and in Advanced Settings check Allow auto-make to start even if developed application is currently running.
