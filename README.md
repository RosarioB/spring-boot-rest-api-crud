# spring-boot-rest-api-crud
Basic Spring Boot Rest API with CRUD for MySQL

Branches:
- basic_crud_mysql: contains DAO implementations of JPA methods for CRUD operations in MySQL
- crud_spring_data_jpa: makes use of Spring data JPA to implement the DAO. So the JPA methods for CRUD operations are auto generated by Spring Data JPA.
