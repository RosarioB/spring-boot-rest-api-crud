# spring-boot-rest-api-crud
Basic Spring Boot Rest APIs with CRUD for MySQL

Branches:
- basic_crud_mysql: contains the DAO interface EmployeeDAO and its implementation EmployeeDAOJpaImpl. The JPA methods for CRUD operations have been manually developed.
- crud_spring_data_jpa: makes use of Spring data JPA (EmployeeRepository) to implement the DAO. So the JPA methods for CRUD operations are auto generated by Spring Data JPA.
